## Setup

Using emacs with [this config](https://gist.github.com/Aadv1k/2bd92889f3a10a5ffb6298b8fb7d04bf) (and also VsCode as of late)

## Usage

```shell
go run . day01 ./data/day01/input.txt
```

```
===== day01 =====

        (took 6.456µs)
Part02: The sum of all calibration, including words values is 142
        (took 41.131µs)
```
